                                <h3>2018 Division F Humorous Speech</h3>
								<h2>Officially announcing my retirement from Toastmasters</h2>
                                <p class="excert">
I've never been SO confident that I would win a contest before. I thought it would be overwhelmingly in
my favor. I got to the hospital an hour early (typical). I did a practice run outside, it was good. I went to
the conference room for the first time and ran into just three people, including --27--. She
immediately started talking my ear off so I escaped to "stretch my legs". I went back to the car to cry a
little (also typical) and eventually made the final trip back to the conference room.                                
                                </p>
                                <p>
At this point, I'm on my third trip to the restroom. Everything's normal. What you and I mapped out on my
white board turned out to be accurate -- they were using both conference rooms so you were left with
an awkward hallway down the middle, the audience was split pretty widely between the two sections (A
& B). It wasn't that bad, to be honest, I got used to it pretty quickly.
                                </p>

<p>
I was constantly running into hurdles (I think minor for the most part, but still hurdles). I learned that --28--
had reserved the first row for the contestants. It makes sense, perfectly reasonable, but it sort of ruins
my little audience interaction trick. I eventually found --29-- in one of the two seats in the front row
that was NOT reserved. She was on the extreme left (if you're facing the audience). But it had to do -- I
really had no choice. And --29-- was very kind to agree to do it -- she was also a ballot counter, so I really
appreciated her help. She understood the instructions, since she saw my speech before, and was a
great volunteer.
</p>
<p>
I then tried to find someone to record my speech with my phone. My next hurdle -- I was talking a little
bit to the woman who placed 2nd at the Area 62 contest. She had the perfect vantage point to record so
I asked her for help. She actually refused. She said she had a role and couldn't do it (I learned she was
SAA - not a very big commitment!). I realized I'm pretty sure she was giving me "shade" (millennial talk
for being mean to me). I guess it's sour grapes since I beat her before, but it was eventually obvious to
me.
</p>
<p>
They did Table Topics first which also made me antsy because I have to wait even longer to speak. I sat
down next to --17--, she placed first at the area (talked about her high school diary). She was
delightful to sit with; very funny person. Iʼll go through the Table Topics contestants (though it was pretty
boring to be honest). The question was silly, “Halloween is coming up. Trick or Treat?” That was
seriously it lol.

<h1>Table Topics</h1>
<p>
<ol>
<li> --30--</li>
His answer was muddled and confusing. He somehow tied trick or treating into an encounter he had with
a lion in Africa? He placed third I think.
<li> --31--</li>
I think he tried to suggest that not all “tricks” are bad, he suggested like volunteering or whatever during
Halloween to help the needy? Made no sense - haha. I donʼt remember if he placed.
<li> --22--</li>
She was very funny right out of the gate. She started by saying “BOO!” And then got into the difference
between tricks and treats and told a personal story about her eating “healthy” foods in the office. She
placed first.
<li> --32--</li>
So this was interesting because she was also competing in the humor contest. So I got a flavor of
Janeʼs speaking ability from her table topics. Her answer was pretty bad, I donʼt remember if she placed.
I think she didnʼt place and #2 above mightʼve placed second. Anyway, her speaking style felt pretty
monotone and slow. So I got a good feeling that I would beat her in the humor contest.
</ol>
</p>
<h1>Humorous Speech</h1>
<p>
<ol>
<li> --32--</li>
I was right. Her speech was pretty mundane & boring. Her speaking style just isnʼt suitable for humor.
She talked about raising her two daughters. She basically just told about three personal stories. They
were funny in nature but had no punch line so her jokes didnʼt really connect well with the audience. She
didnʼt place.
<li> --17--</li>
She did the same thing she did at the Area contest. It was good, but I would argue not second place
worthy stuff. She basically read from a diary and had no real point or takeaway. She was very funny, her
jokes definitely connected. She placed second.
<li> Paul Ireifej</li>
<p>
I thought I did well, and was very confident I would win. Haha. I placed third. By the time I got up there, I
had a pretty bad headache. My head wasnʼt that clear but I managed to remember everything. I paused
for a little bit at one point because I lost track but I recovered very quickly so it looked just like a normal
pause that anyone would do for effect. I got laughs at all the right places. I stuttered for real when I said
the letter “D” during the phone conversation like I did at the club. I recorded my speech (did it myself
since no one else wanted to — haha). Iʼll share it probably via Google Drive. Iʼll watch it first, though.
Maybe tomorrow. I basically did everything I meant to; it was a well executed and polished speech. I
donʼt know what I couldʼve done differently. Even though --29-- was very helpful, this was seriously the
ONE time I wanted her to be LOUD (like she always is), but she read from the paper very softly. It was
hard to hear her. :-( Also, being that she was sitting in the extreme left I literally jogged over to give her
the dollar and jogged back to the center to continue my speech.
</p>
<li> --33--</li>
This guy placed first. I thought heʼd place either 3rd or not place at all. He was just bad. First of all, he
wasnʼt dressed well at all. He had jeans and a black polo shirt. Iʼm not saying your attire should be the
end-all, but he didnʼt even put effort into it. He did what I will call the “Stupid Gimmick” (hereby referred
to as “SG”) where he did the generic deep movie trailer voice like “This summer, blah blah blah”. He did
SG like 3 - 4 times ... maybe more. The first time he did it was fine. It got laughs. But it got redundant
very quickly! It was silly to do it multiple times. His speech was (I think) about him getting a job. So he
had a lot of office-related humor — like boring meetings, status meetings, project management, etc. It
wasnʼt personal, pretty generic, and just very sloppy. It felt like something he did almost ad-hoc or just
practiced very little. It sounded like a story he would tell friends whilst drinking beer. His movements
werenʼt at all intentioned, his speech wasnʼt crisp, he actually had filler words. He used “so” as a
transition multiple times. His jokes connected for the most part; many jokes didnʼt. I donʼt understand
the appeal. Unless since he went last, the judges remembered him the most? First place to me was just
out of the question — it was obvious to me that heʼd place at the bottom.
</ol>
</p>
<p>
When they announced the results, I noticed --28-- looked at me before announcing the third place winner.
I got a really bad feeling about it — thatʼs never a good sign haha. I was shocked at first, I thought it was
a mistake, but almost immediately felt relieved and OK. I knew I did the best I could and was convinced I
shouldʼve won. When they read Jay as the winner, I knew things were just flipped. It made no sense to
me. At least Brittany deserved her second place spot.
</p>
<p>
I keep going back to the confidence I felt when each contestant went up. I knew --32-- wouldnʼt place.
--17-- speech seemed like a cop out; she read from a diary and had no purpose. --33-- was sloppy and
just had poor execution. Thatʼs the part that bothers me. Mine felt very crisp, practiced, good content,
strong message and generally good jokes.
</p>
<p>
I shall end my rant here and try to sleep. I hope you enjoyed reading this email even though itʼs largely
angry and complain-y. Haha.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for tying my tie for me, it was very easy for me to put on. Maybe you want to pull a --4-- and
adopt me. And thanks as always for your support. You are now allowed to compete in the next contest
because I wonʼt compete. I know I say this every time and sound like --4-- but Iʼm done competing
FOREVER. Hahahaha. Also Henry Ford is a racist LOL.
