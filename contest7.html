                                <h3>2016 District Humorous Speech</h3>
								<h2>Ranting</h2>
                                <p class="excert">
I'll start this long rant by saying that I did very well and I'm proud of myself and the progress I made. It was the best version
of that speech. I even had a callback that worked out very well. I got good laughs at all the expected places (except the
pants joke which is mediocre anyway).                          
                                </p>

                                <p>
The first speaker (who ended up winning the contest) talked about her difficulty with communication because she comes
from Japan. She had a joke about her difficulty to say election because it sounds like erection. I substituted my "attention"
joke with something you'll hear in the video: "You have to pay attention to your son. Unless he's trying to say election and it
sounds like erection. Then just ignore it." Something like that. It got a lot of laughs.
                                </p>

I disagree completely with the woman who won 2nd place. Her speech was disgusting. It was a speech about getting old.
She used that same thing you did in your speech about being old. I don't remember the words but it was like a poem that
rhymed. It had something about farting in it. She talked about her body parts including her breasts. It was crude and
disgusting. There's even something in the rules about how the speech shouldn't contain crude language.
</p>
<p>
The contestants who won third and first place deserved it. The Japanese woman was very funny. The third place talked
about his GPS. His jokes were clever and well executed.
</p>
<p>
This will sound like sour grapes but I thought I did the best (oh really, Paul?). I even had a call back! Another woman had a
callback to the same speech but didn't go over as well. When they announced the third and second place winners I thought I
got it. But I was SO surprised about that second place winner. She really shouldn't have placed.
</p>
<p>
Now to spread rumors. I heard (people are saying) that the judges were all women so the women competition had an edge
by default. And, thinking about it, all speakers except 3 were women but one guy placed so I'm not totally convinced about
that theory though it might explain that 2nd place winner.
</p>
<p>
The other thing is I heard something about speaker order that goes against my original theory (or at least is an amendment
to my theory). People are saying that the first and last speakers have the edge. I was super happy when I got 4 for my
speaking order. But the middle may not be the best after all. The idea is that judges use the first speech as the standard
(since it's the best speech at that point since it's the only one they heard so far) and judge subsequent speeches against
that. And the last speech is also preferred since it's fresh in their mind. It's like how when you read an email you usually read
the beginning, the end and skim the rest of it. Like what you're probably doing with my email.
</p>
<p>
--3-- (excuse my French) pisses me off. He came up to me afterwards and said "we need to talk later." I knew exactly
what he wanted to talk about and almost threw my diaper bag in his face. He made reference to the "political" joke. I
responded to him very impatiently but told him I don't agree and the joke got good response. He then said that he's proud of
me because I came a long way (keep in mind he was with me from the beginning. He knows the awful place I started from
with TM). I appreciate the kind words he used eventually but that should've been the only thing he told me.
</p>
<p>
One person was disqualified for going over time. People thought it was me and that's why I didn't place. But I was sitting
right next to the timers and saw the woman who went over. She went 7 min 31 seconds. I was shocked. It's such a shame.
Granted, her speech wasn't that good anyway.
</p>
<p>
I would say there were like 3 speeches that simply weren't good. Got very few laughs and not polished.
My interview was hilarious and sincere and wonderful:

<p>
Watch closely in the interview. At one point, the camera man comes up to me to take a picture. I stop talking, look at him and
smile. The timing was perfect. It got good laughs.
</p>
<p>
So, thanks for reading. I'll complain about it next time we meet in person. Thanks for your pep talk and your continued
support. Even if I'm not area director, I'm retiring from contests. It's probably the cocaine talking but I really don't feel I have
anything more to prove. I feel that any future attempts would be me just trying the same thing but hoping I have good luck.
--4-- was amazing. He should've won first place. He was hilarious. His speech had pure emotion. It made us laugh, cry and
everything in between.
</p>
<p>
Sorry for my vicious rant.
</p> 
<p>
I realized I sent my rant to you from my gmail account. I copied over the thread into this email so I can use icloud (just more
convenient for me). First of all, I have your CISSP book ready to return to you. It's still in good condition! I took good care of it. I'll
give it back as soon as you return to the office. I hope the appointment today is going (or went) well.
</p>
<p>
Just a few other tidbits I thought of. Not ranting, just quirky details for amusement. I always struggle with finding a place to sit for
a contest and this past Saturday was no exception. I ended up sitting next to ${5} for the first half the contest (the table
topics portion). This turned out to be a mistake (shouldn't have been a surprise but my judgement isn't great when I'm stressed
out - haha). He made side comments to me after each table topic contestant was done and his clapping literally broke my left
ear. Yes, his clapping is that loud!
</p>
<p>
Speaking of evaluating, I went through the list of candidates on the district 83 website and have comments about their speech. I
find it kind of soothing and it's a good retrospective:
</p>
<p>
--1-- (2nd place winner) - Her speech was about getting old. Even though her speech was crude and disgusting, she got a
lot of laughs. The material was very female-centric for sure and probably only relate-able to the women in the audience. She
used that Dr. Seuss poem I mentioned meaning a good bulk of her content wasn't even her own.
</p>
<p>
--2-- - This was the guy who won first place at the first district humorous contest I attended years ago.
Unfortunately, I didn't watch his speech because I had to step out to call my wife and check up on them. From time to time, I
stood close to the doors of the room during his speech and I heard a decent amount of laughter. I tried to peek in between the
doors and saw him holding a blue folder so I'm guessing he used props.
</p>
<p>
The following four contestants I don't remember and (coincidentally) there were three contestants who's speeches weren't
memorable though I think they got good laughs. One woman spoke about her heritage, another spoke about "aliens" which
meant her teenagers and how they speak a language that's practically foreign, another told a story about a road trip she had with
someone who was diabetic and always used the phrased "... but that's beside the point" which was clever but I felt over used.
The "alien" woman went over time (7 min 31 sec). A fourth woman (I think Majorie) gave a speech that was definitely more
motivational opposed to humorous but definitely fell short on both counts. It was about her playing baseball as a child (I think?). I
tuned it out after like 1 minute of listening.
</p>
<ul>
<li>--6--</li>
<li>--7--</li>
<li>--8--</li>
<li>--9--</li>
</ul>
<p>
--10-- (3rd place winner) - Spoke about his "girlfriend" which was later revealed to be his GPS. This was a GOOD
speech. He deserved second place; must cleaner material than Dori). He had very clever jokes, speech was memorable, he
spoke about an instance where his Google Maps GPS was arguing with his Garmin. Very funny!
</p>
<p>
--11-- (1rst place winner) - Definitely deserved a place in the top 3. She spoke about her difficulty with pronouncing
English words (given she was born in Japan). She had very good gestures, vocal variety, got good laughs. I felt she had too
much "down time" like too much background information about herself; basically, time with no laughs. It was a decent amount of
non-entertaining set up material that allowed me to drift off (maybe I just have a short attention span). My guess is that her
speech had more weight (if you follow the judging criteria strictly) because her message had an inspirational undertone. It was
how she was taught that "silence is gold" but she learned that the gold is worth nothing. So, it was a powerful and original
message -- good optimistic take away.
</p>
<p>
In my opinion, the order should've been: Me 1rst (obviously), --11-- 2nd and --10-- 3rd. We had the best speeches. --1-- getting
up there HAD to be due to politics (either intentionally or unintentionally) or some kind of fluke. 3 days later I still think it's
ridiculous. Hahaha.
</p>
<p>
The lessons that I can probably learn from this are:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Luck is involved in all stages in the competition and it influences the outcome. Basically, the contests are rigged (joking!). From
speaking order to judge selection (especially from the perspective of whether or not the judges are really following the judging criteria), many, many, many factors are variable, non-trivial and out of our control independent of our speeches.</li>
<li>The message is important. It's good to have a theme/motto and refer back to the motto throughout the speech in creative
ways. You might think of the humorous speech as being inspirational that has jokes interleaved smoothly.</li>
<li>No matter what level of the competition, a significant number of contestants won't be good. So, even if there are 10
contestants you still have a good chance of winner with a polished and well intentioned speech. Also, stuff happens like speakers
will drop out and the 2nd place speakers will have to step up. It doesn't mean their speeches are bad but they're typically not as
prepared & rehearsed as they should be.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The other thing that came to mind is that your speech and --4--'s speeches are very competitive. I still feel bad that you didn't
get through but think your material and presentation is good enough for the district level.
</p>
<p>
The other interesting tidbit: the drive to the contest was kind of an adventure. I left our house 5 min to 1 and --4-- was driving
into the driveway while I was stepping out. I love his punctuality. We didn't have to wait too long at all for --5--; maybe 3
minutes. So my concern was moot.
</p>
<p>
First off, --5-- had his long rants about stuff .. I just laid back and tried to phase it out.
I'm actually to blame for the "adventure" part and thank God we had 30 min buffer time! We ran into traffic because a lane was
closed (thanks, Christie!). It took a long time to get out of it so I had to admit to --4-- and --5-- that I REALLY had to pee. I
told them that I have anxiety before a contest and will have an emergency very, very soon. I think the words I used were, "We
might have to clean this seat if we don't find a restroom soon." --4-- was kind enough to take an exit and find a gas station.
During this time, --5-- just HAD to tell us a "joke". He told you that our sense of humor is "corny." Well his sense of humor
sucks -- plain & simple. It was this LONG joke about elephants. "How many elephants blah blah and then how many elephants
blah blah ..". I felt like it went on for 30 min. --4-- and I told him the joke is stupid. I told him not even my kids would enjoy that
joke. That made my "holding it" much more painful.
</p>
<p>
I ran inside, did my business and got out. --4-- was super angry because he also tried to use the restroom but the person
working there was mean to him and didn't let him in (I think I must've ran in behind the guy's back or something! I wasn't stopped
at all). I felt bad because --4-- was furious (like cursing) so I felt it might impact his performance at the contest. After that, we
missed some turns getting back to the highway which was unfortunate but still managed to get to the hotel with ample time.
</p>
<p>
After that, things seemed to settle down. I emailed --4-- and --5-- when I got back home that night to apologize (again) for
the incident but was honest with --4--: I told him he did the best he possibly could with the question. Everything I said in my
presidential email to the group Saturday night is 100% true. He deserved to win but had to settle with 2nd place which is still a
very significant accomplishment for table topics.
</p>
<p>
Finally, in conclusion, I wanted to say that the microphone was indeed transparent. What I didn't know is that audio professionals
set up the contestants ahead of time. Just one time I accidentally hit it with my hand when I added "... of Toastmasters" following
my very offensive "Trump" joke. People were laughing at that point anyway so I doubt people heard it. But other than that, it
worked flawlessly and had 0 impact on my performance.
</p>
<p>
Thanks! Sorry again for the long email. When we meet again, we won't have anything else to talk about. Haha. Good luck with
your appointments today.
