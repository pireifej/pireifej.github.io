										Basic trust develops in an environment where people respond appropriately to the child’s communication of needs to be 
		loved, respected and accepted. Infant and toddlers alike learn through their senses. They learn by watching and moving freely in the environment. 
		The child is considered as a whole person and is affected by the quality of holding and feeding, as well as the quality of physical care. 
		Freedom to move is essential to the development of child’s potential. Learning, which leads to independence, occurs where the child participates in their 
		daily routines of care. The children must be spoken to in the language with which they will communicate.

										This sensitive period of the child’s life has many physical and emotional needs that 
									can be met in a uniquely prepared toddler environment. The environment for the toddlers is very nurturing and calm community as these children 
									are often experiencing their first interactions with other children. A qualified Montessori teacher directs each class to offer the tenderness, 
									warmth, and patience so essential to this age. The space is beautifully designed to appeal to the child’s curiosity. The materials in the room 
									continue to change as the child grows emotionally, physically, and intellectually. An emphasis on the importance of a peaceful environment, 
									with necessary nurturing and caring, is characteristic of this program. Learn more about our toddler programs.
