		The Montesmontessori toddlersori Infant Program is designed to foster the development of basic trust and to assist in the normal development 
		of the personality. Basic trust develops in an environment where people respond appropriately to the child’s communication of needs to be 
		loved, respected and accepted. Infant and toddlers alike learn through their senses. They learn by watching and moving freely in the environment. 
		The child is considered as a whole person and is affected by the quality of holding and feeding, as well as the quality of physical care. 
		Freedom to move is essential to the development of child’s potential. Learning, which leads to independence, occurs where the child participates in their 
		daily routines of care. The children must be spoken to in the language with which they will communicate. Learn more about our infant program.</p>

									warmth, and patience so essential to this age. The space is beautifully designed to appeal to the child’s curiosity. The materials in the room 
									continue to change as the child grows emotionally, physically, and intellectually. An emphasis on the importance of a peaceful environment,

									<h3>Enrichment Programs</h3>
									<p>In the Montessori environment, children are exposed to a variety of experiences that enrich their academic experience and develop the 
									whole person. The following enrichment programs are offered to all toddler and primary class children:</p>
									
									<h4>Music</h4>
									<span class="image"><img src="images/piano_keys-300x199.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>The music materials provide a vehicle for self-expression, self-understanding, self-confidence, creative problem solving and motivation. 
									Children create their own rhythms and incorporate music into other areas of the classroom. The music program is an exciting and fun 
									curriculum taught by professional music teachers. Through singing, movement, speaking, body sound rhythms, playing simple melody 
									instruments and percussion instruments with music scores and improvisation, children learn the love and joys of music. 
									Music programs will be provided for all the children at the Manalapan Montessori in addition to the regularly scheduled classes and 
									various solo instrumental classes will also be offered throughout the year.</p>
									
									<h4>Physical Education</h4>
									<p>The Physical Education program gives children the opportunity to learn cooperative games and basic sports in a fun and interactive 
									atmosphere. Positive encouragement, teamwork, problem solving, good sportsmanship, and physical exercise are key components in our Physical 
									Education program as well as continuing to practice self-respect and respect for one another.</p>
									
									<h3>After School Programs</h3>
									<p>Our after school environment seeks to complement the children’s 12466237-littl-child-drawing-paint-isolated-on-whiteMontessori 
									experience and give them more exposure to educational toys (i.e. Lego, dolls,blocks). The pace of the after school programs is 
									intentionally more relaxed with time for free play and outdoor activities. Children in after-care can enjoy a variety of other optional 
									programs (additional fees apply) not offered in the regular class.  These programs include art lessons and foreign language lessons.</p>

									<h4>Foreign Languages</h4>
									<p>Young children are uniquely suited to learning a second language. The developing brain is hard-wired to acquire language – never again will 
									it be this natural or this easy! Foreign language lessons are offered to our primary class children in our foreign language program. 
									Taught by experienced teachers, your child will learn a foreign language in a fun and interactive environment. Learning a foreign language 
									will help prepare your child for the future as the world becomes more globally connected.</p>
