                                <p class="excert">
                                    In lieu of us being unable to meet up in person for what will feel like an eternity, I decided to piece together my CFCA experience in this email (complete with
                                    pictures!).                                
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    It was, as you can imagine, a very good experience. Actually, one of the people Iʼve been corresponding with about the event is some director at AT&T (had
                                    no idea!) and even he gave me very positive feedback and told me that others at the conference had very positive feedback as well. Obviously, my manager
                                    was kept in the loop with the feedback and thus, my plan to get a window office is resumed. Hahahahahaha. Thatʼs right!! I did all of this just to get a window
                                    office. It wonʼt happen, but I keep trying. ^_^
                                </p>

                                            Flying to Chicago was eventful, in a bad way. My original flight was canceled on Monday morning and rescheduled to late afternoon from LaGuardia. Not
                                            sure if youʼve ever been to that airport but getting there is pretty horrendous. I was already in Newark airport when I learned about the change. Iʼm glad that
                                            AT&T pays for the transportation, I was using Lyft to get everywhere (very convenient way to travel, BTW!).                                 
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            When I got to Chicago finally, I was pretty exhausted. You would think that my nights in Chicago would be super pleasant, what with all the non-crying. But I
                                            woke up at around 2 AM to a weird, very loud, hum noise. Not sure if it was coming from outside or in the hotel, but it was definitely disruptive. And then I
                                            couldnʼt go back to sleep. So I went out to some office area on the same floor and did some work and reviewed my slides for the presentation the next day. I
                                            visited the conference room where I would be speaking (pictures taken at around 2:30 AM):

                                            I was a little disappointed at first because the room didnʼt seem to have a large capacity, and I expected like a thousand people there (hahaha). But itʼs good
                                            enough to the point where I would get scared. They also already had the soda laid out, so it was nice to know Iʼd be able to drink very unhealthy things that
                                            evening. :-)
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            I eventually went back to sleep but weʼre talking about the wee hours of the morning at this point. I guess Iʼm getting used to giving speeches on very little
                                            sleep. Itʼs not like I could sleep during the actual conference itself (I was sitting through other peopleʼs presentations, many of which were rather boring).
                                            So, about an hour and a half before my presentation it finally dawns on me, “Hey, this is it.” Instead of listening to peopleʼs talks, Iʼd be doing one of my own.
                                            It was really cool to listen to other peopleʼs presentation styles. I remember two who were particularly bad: one gentleman (actually ran into him in the hotel
                                            lobby later that night) just looked directly into his laptop screen the entire time. He never made eye contact and had many filler words.
                                            Another young lady, who admitted she was nervous, looked back at her slides a lot and had MANY filler words — Iʼd almost say every other word. She also
                                            spoke very quietly and did not handle questions well at all.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            There was an AI presentation that was supposed to happen just before my own. The speaker wasnʼt there so they moved onto me! My heart skipped many
                                            beats. They did not read my introduction (which I emailed them a while back) and just called me up. The host naturally pronounced my name wrong even
                                            though he confirmed the pronunciation with me moments before (and got it right that time).
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            While I was sitting at my table, there was a very nice English gentleman named Richard who flew there all the way from .. uhh... I dunno, Europe? Britain?
                                            Some English country — my geography isnʼt very good. Nor is my intellect. Or general knowledge of things. LOL. He was actually very pleasant to speak with
                                            (maybe because of his lovely accent). Heʼs married and has two daughters who are in high school so we related to each other in a way. Anyway, he joked
                                            with me and I then subsequently stole both jokes to use as an ice breaker during my presentation (more on that later). He commented on the title of my
                                            presentation “Steps to Manage a Successful Fraud System Migration” and said something like “Oh, Iʼm glad it was successful.” And he made another
                                            comment about how they have happy hour just after my presentation (mine was the last on the agenda before the evening events).
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            I felt pretty gosh darn nervous. I was snacking on a pretzel they had maybe an hour before I got up. I wasnʼt hungry but it was late in the afternoon/early
                                            evening and I knew I should put something in my belly so I donʼt pass out. When I got up, the host confirmed he has the right slides up. He set me up with
                                            the microphone (it was one that just clipped onto my suit jacket which was great). It reminded me of doing the district speech contest - haha.
                                            The one thing I forgot when I got up to the podium was my phone. They didnʼt have a timer like in Toastmasters so I had meant to pace myself. I didnʼt really
                                            know how long I did, if I was too short and or went too long, I just had to rely on my practice runs at our club which isnʼt precise.

                                            So, I opened with jokes!!! And they laughed!!! This was after suffering through some rather boring speakers so Iʼm glad I could quickly connect with the
                                            audience right off the bat. The host introduced me a little bit by saying Iʼm from AT&T. So I started by asking, just out of curiosity, how many people in the
                                            audience (by a show of hands) are using AT&T as their network provider. After they raised their hands, I said, “Oh, Iʼm so sorry to hear that. Iʼd ask you to mute your phones but if you got a call it wouldnʼt go through anyway.” That got a lot of laughs. Itʼs a reliable joke because I used it when I chaired the area
                                            62 contest. Yay
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            I also mentioned that Iʼm the only thing standing between “all of you” and happy hour so Iʼll try to make this presentation painless. That also got laughs. 
                                            When I got to the presentation title, I emphasized that the migration was “successful.” If it wasnʼt, I wouldnʼt be up there speaking to them. That got some chuckles.

                                        <p>
                                            Anyway, I definitely got things off to a good start, with some help from my new friend Richard. I went to the slide (I think you saw it) with the quote and all of
                                            the hands on top of each other. I really liked the way I introduced the quote and I read it out loud this time (I donʼt think I did it at our club). I joked and told
                                            them this is the only important slide of the presentation so they can go back to checking email and playing games on their phone (that also got laughs). I
                                            told them that a system migration shouldnʼt be viewed just as getting rid of the old system, but rather as teamwork and working with the new system to
                                            expand it and build upon it. It was a good way to introduce a boring topic. Haha.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The rest of the presentation was pretty much autopilot, just based on my practice runs at out club. I honestly didnʼt really review it that much (or even do
                                            practice runs) since our club. The last two slides I feel I fumbled because I didnʼt practice it at our club. It really goes to show how important Toastmasters is
                                            as a platform to run through these things. It helps on so many levels.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The Q&A was by far my favorite part (aside from getting laughs). Itʼs REALLY cool to listen to the audienceʼs feedback through their questions. When people
                                            asked questions, I walked towards them like politicians do at town halls. I really felt like I connected with the audience, it feels very special.
                                            They had good questions. One person in the audience asked a tough question about how I make the decision to cut out code thatʼs no longer useful versus
                                            re-implementing it from scratch. Like at what point do you determine itʼs best to just re-engineer the entire module. I didnʼt have a good answer and
                                            definitely fumbled around with no real content. :-(
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Other than that, I got a total of like 6 questions which was a lot more than other speakers and felt my responses were strong and meaningful. It was really
                                            cool that my talk generated a lot of interest.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            One person asked if it was easy to get the old users to move over to use the new system. I started by saying, “Yes. Iʼm very handsome and good with selling
                                            things so it was easy.” I paused and said, “Iʼm just joking” and that got laughs. I also told them that I get into a lot of arguments with my wife and I feel
                                            theyʼre not driven by logic on her end but, rather, by emotion. I related that to getting users to move off of an old system — how their attachment is really
                                            just emotional and not a functional one. It was a nice way to answer the question with a personal touch. Also, Iʼm pretty sure I offended all of the married
                                            women in the audience. Hahaha.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            During my presentation, I remember one guy in particular yawning A LOT. And he did it with the upmost confidence, making direct eye contact with me while
                                            yawning. Hahaha. I learned to not mind these things especially with a varied audience. And it was in the early evening anyway, Iʼm sure many people were
                                            sleepy at that point.

                                            I think thatʼs about it. Here is a picture of Happy Paul (HP for short) after my presentation when they handed me a nice certificate.
