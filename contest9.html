                                <h3>2019 Area 62 Evaluation 1st Place</h3>
								<h2>The Contest Heard Around the World</h2>
                                <p class="excert">
Welcome to the longest area contest in the history of contests. Iʼm still recovering from a whopping 4 1/2 hour long contest. I arrived there at 615 PM (with my kids — long story, much like this email). It ended at 1030 PM.                         
                                </p>
                                <p>
I arrived at Bell Works to pick up the kids at around 5 PM. I was going to pick up the kids with my wife and have her take them home by herself so I can head
to the contest. I get a text from her saying that sheʼs going to be late with no ETA. Naturally, I do the only Paulian thing to do, which is to panic. After a good
10 to 15 minutes of checking the time, pacing and heavy breathing, I make the Executive Decision to pick up the kids myself and take them to the hospital
(not because Iʼm going to have a heart attack; thatʼs just the contest venue). I did it and it was good. We had fun. For the kids, it was a little adventure and
for a brief moment they got to share in doing something that daddy enjoys. They were very well behaved and I had them situated soon after finding the
conference room. I gave them cookies and wraps that was provided to us. It was probably the most pleasant part of the evening. My wife eventually met us
at the hospital to pick them up (before contestant briefings).

I had a mild hiccup early on. Thereʼs this lady who, in my opinion, has a bad attitude. Sheʼs in the Old Bridge club and gave me trouble during the contest
last year as well. I wonʼt name names because Iʼm a decent person but it begins with a --34-- and ends with a --35--. When I got to the room
originally, I found a very nice spot at the table right in the front. I was happy with it and claimed it for my own. I had my iPad to entertain the kids when they
were there (via Paw Patrol) so placed that on the table in front of the chair. I even put something in the chair itself. I then left to use the bathroom.
</p>
<p>
Upon my arrival, I found --34-- physically moving my stuff aside to take my seat. It was appalling. I think old, confidence-less Paul, wouldʼve apologized and
found another seat. But new, post-many-contests-Paul gave her the attitude she deserved. I told her, and I quote, “This is definitely my seat. And Iʼm NOT moving.” While she put my stuff back, I said, “Iʼm sorry, I thought it was obvious because I put down my giant iPad.” I was really pissed off. I then stood there,
begrudgingly, with my arms crossed making random animal huffing & puffing noises waiting while she took her sweet time finding another spot that was
convenient for her. She ended up sitting right next to me anyway hahaha. I felt a little bad and tried to make small talk but she shrugged me off.
</p>
<h1>Let the Contests Begin!</h1>
<p>
As is Toastmasters tradition, they started about 10 minutes late (actually, not that bad!). It started with Area 61 International Speech Contest. Hereʼs my
summary for this (and possibly all) international speech contests: itʼs a series of personal tragedies and whomever suffered the worst tragedy wins. ^_^
</p>
<h2>Area 61</h2>
<p>
(In speaking order)
<ul>
<li>--14-- — placed third (The Unconscious Mind)</li>
<p>
This was my dear friend --14-- from the humor contest who had volunteered to read a line during my humor speech. He had a very --5-- - like
speech. Heʼs apparently into neuroscience / mind stuff. His speech was about the “unconscious mind.” He started off by saying that he missed a turn on the
drive here. Then got into some mental mumbo jumbo. He got in quite a few laughs. It was a good, finely mediocre speech, but certainly not very memorable.
Felt more like classroom teaching. And I didnʼt feel the takeaway was strong (whatever it was).
</p>
<li> --36-- — placed second (Risk & Reward)</li>
<p>
This gentleman is very funny. He speaks with a slight accent but he had a good general message. He talked about “risk and reward” and gave about three
examples of situations where the reward outweighed the risk. He tried to tie it back into how we should weigh the risk versus reward in our lives and do
things, blah, blah, wonderful. It was OK, but I wish the examples he gave were personal stories. Like he gave one example that “all guys should be familiar
with” about a guy in a bar trying to flirt with a lady. Sorry, --36--, not all guys have been in this situation LOL. So it wasnʼt relatable to me, though the way he
presented the example got laughs. He also talked about weighing the pressure of paying off a mortgage versus the potential reward of starting your own
business, much like the Facebook people, and possibly scoring it big. Sorry, --36--, but the chances of doing something of that magnitude are VERY slim. Itʼs
just a weak argument — not a strong sell. But heʼs witty and clever and delivers humor well.
</p>
<li> --31-- - placed first</li>
<p>
He had a very interesting story about hiking up the wrong mountain. He transitioned into saying how heʼs directionally challenged but didnʼt let that stop him
from doing more hiking expeditions. It was a good speech, though I donʼt remember the lesson he was trying to have as a takeaway. He delivered it very
well, with humor, and was generally very polished and animated.
</p>
</ul>
<h2>Area 62</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li> --20-- - placed third (Blood Brothers)</li>
<p>
This guy blew me away. He spoke with such conviction and genuine emotion, Iʼm pretty sure the entire audience was moved; many were probably moved to
tears. He gave a very dramatic recounting of his best friend from school. They moved away at some point and he learned his friend got sick. He visited his
friend in the hospital only to learn that his friend became severally disabled. He turned away at first but his mom encouraged him to go back. It developed
into a very strong friendship and Don has a new appreciation for the disabled. I think Donʼs strength led to his downfall and less-than-warranted placement.
It was just TOO much. It was too dramatic, too emotional and it became overwhelming. Donʼs speech requires an emotional investment. After listening to
three speakers in Area 61, it was just a lot to take in at night. I was exhausted after the speech. Also, there was a little too much shouting on his end. He
raised his voice at the appropriate times, but then even when he was teaching us a lesson he spoke “at” us with a little too much vigor. It became slightly
over the top drama. Like, I felt nervous to disagree with him when he made his points. Also, his message is too narrow. I think he was encouraging us to
interact with and appreciate the disabled community. Itʼs a very specific group of people that he wants us to show appreciation for. I think he pigeon-holed
his mantra.
</p>
<li> --12-- - did not place (Involuntary Immigrant)</li>
<p>
This was the best version of his speech that I heard. Unfortunately, his speech wasnʼt entirely strong to begin with. And he was up against really good
competition in Area 62 tonight. Iʼm thinking that Area 62 ups the ante each year. --12-- did manage to cut out a lot of the extraneous information in his
speech. He definitely did a good job using the chisel. But, in the end, his speech just sounds like a pity party. He was tortured and abused as a child — no
one would argue with that. But it doesnʼt go anywhere. The takeaway for us isnʼt compelling. He didnʼt use my line of going home to hug your kids. Instead,
he replaced it with some wishy washy line of “go forth and show more affection to people.” He delivered the father death scene with ample conviction,
though I felt his original speech at the club (even before the club contest) did the father death scene much better. --12-- has good content and stories to
tell but just canʼt package it quite right.
</p>
<li> --37-- - placed first (Best Worst Thing)</li>
<p>
Holy Moses. HOLY MOSES. Dave nailed it. I canʼt think of any suggestions for improvement. It was a beautiful heartfelt speech delivered with genuine
emotion & conviction. And, boy oh boy, was --37-- tortured as a child. He spoke about a time in high school his “friend” jokingly sprayed acid on his face. No
kidding. The way he described the immediate aftermath of the incident as the acid ate away at his face was perfection. I never heard anything described as
poignantly at this. He described the incident as there being three screams. The first scream was from the pain. The second scream was from the insides of
his face being exposed to the elements. The third scream never happened because the nerve endings in his face were gone. He described this as the “best
worst thing” that ever happened to him. He was always shy and didnʼt have many friends. But after the incident everyone knew who he was. He also got the
second biggest laugh of the night (next to this guy Paul Ireifej; more on that later). So, yeah, congrats --37-- — he deserved this win.
</p>
<li> --38-- - placed second (One Simple Rule)</li>
<p>
Our favorite android is back. Tonight, --38-- practiced the human trait of “vocal variety.” She glitched tonight and got stuck in “high” volume mode and
ran with it. She yelled out a speech about being awkward with guys and explaining the many rules that existed with dating. She then told us how she met her
husband. Sorry, I need to take a quick break to yawn. OK, Iʼm back. I always feel thereʼs a “flop” with any speech contest. --38-- speech certainly felt
very floppy, yet she managed to place second. How she beat out Don Matts is anyoneʼs guess. Iʼm thinking her speech relates very strongly to woman. Iʼm
not sure. Congrats! Or 1001000101110.
</p>
</ul>
</p>
<h1>Area 32</h1>
<p>
At this point, I literally snapped. Oneʼs brain can only take so much. Many of the speeches were good so it wasnʼt a situation like the area humor contest last
year, but it was exhausting to sit through TWO areas knowing that one more area is still pending. I know I snapped because I kept giggling (out loud, mind
you) during the next speech. The humor flood gates couldnʼt be contained any longer and I kept on coming up with joke after joke after joke that I had
apparently found HILARIOUS.
</p>
<p>
I think at some point during the evening, someone sent out a text message to everyone saying that “louder is better.” The next two speakers yelled out their
speech.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li> --39-- - placed second (Spider Story?)</li>
<p>
She had a prop of a box. Clipped to that box was some artwork of a spider. Hereʼs the thing: the box was pretty big and was clearly a box for an HP laptop. I
kept thinking that she was showing everyone an empty box of an HP laptop. I barely looked at the spider because the letters H and P kept talking to me. I
donʼt know why she clipped a picture of a spider to an HP box and, to my disappointment, I never will. Throughout her speech, I heard the same questions
repeat “Why did you clip a picture of a spider to an HP box? Why not simply .... <gasp> ... hold up the picture and maybe even (dare I say) pan the picture
briefly from side to side?” Eventually, the HP box became the mantra of her speech. She yelled out a story about how she failed her exams in school and she
could barely talk to her mom. I thought to myself: “BIG deal. Dave had half his face burned off and could barely talk to ANYONE.” Hahahahahaha. Going after
Dave, everyone elseʼs tragedies seemed childish.
</p>
<li>--40-- - placed third (Pig Syndrome)</li>
<p>
I donʼt remember much of his speech because I was trying hard to stay awake. My mind is numb and empty at this point, much like an empty HP box. I think
his speech was good; it was about lessons that his father taught him. One good thing that came out of his speech was the quote “What canʼt be cured must
be endured.” This line got a lot of laughs. So, I wrote it down and thought to myself, “Hmm.. maybe I can use this for later.” And I did! His speech title was
distracting, “Pig Syndrome.” By the end of his speech, I still didnʼt understand what “pig syndrome” is and I think thatʼs a problem.
</p>
<li>--15-- (AKA seat stealer) - placed first (Just Drive)</li>
<p>
As much as Iʼd like to give a scathing evaluation of --15--, she did a good job. Her speech was about driving on the highway without encouragement from
her husband. One notable joke, in response to a predicament, was something along the lines of, “I know what I needed to do. Get a new husband!”. She told
a good story with well received jokes. After she sat down, during the intermission, I engaged her and had actually back & forth conversation. She was much more relaxed after her speech and thus, one can argue that her poor attitude was due to being tense and nervous which is something we all can relate to.
That being said, I still think itʼs in poor taste to steal someoneʼs seat LOL. I complimented her, much to my chagrin, and gave her some quick feedback. I told
her that I think she placed first because the first two speakers yelled their speech and I didnʼt pay attention. When she spoke, she grabbed my attention
and, um, didnʼt scream. LOL.
</p>
</ul>
</p>
<h1>Evaluation Contest</h1>
<p>
And here we are, international speech gauntlet has ended, and evaluation contest begins!!! We had a very brief intermission, which was good, I had the
opportunity to console --12--, praise & gloat all over --37--, avoid --41-- & --27--, all the things that a standard Paul-during-the-intermission
would do. I commented to my fellow evaluators that itʼs ridiculous to expect us to now *pay attention* to yet another speech *and* give feedback!!!! Our minds are basically numb at this point. Yet we charged ahead.
</p>
<h2>Target Speaker</h2>
<p>
The target speakerʼs name, to this day, is unknown. I wrote down “Katie” on my evaluation sheet but I heard all sorts of variations. I believe the different
names eventually converge to something like “Kadian”. Which sounds like a cool Game of Thrones character name. I donʼt watch Game of Thrones, just saw
the trailer for the last season because, like, whatever. I do what I want. Donʼt judge me!
She was really good. If she was competing in any of the contests, she would be a good contender. She spoke about the fear of public speaking. Sounds like
a standard topic that would be a snooze fest, right? Perhaps something thatʼs overdone and this point? Yes and yes, but she presented her own unique
perspective and it was refreshing and had excellent takeaways (and humor!!!).
</p>
<h2>Paul Ireifej Evaluation</h2>
<p>
So, I was in speaker order #4 (out of 4) for Area 62. Therefore I didnʼt hear any of the evaluations from Area 61 or 62 (except my own). I heard Area 63 but
really didnʼt listen or retain much of anything. I think many of them had good points but didnʼt seem to make a good story / envelope for their feedback. The
exception is a lady --42-- who placed first for Area 63. I felt her actual feedback was lacking but her delivery was great. Someone named --43-- placed second (oh, actually, sheʼs in our club - I think she was the one who did the evaluation on Monday along with me). And --44-- (the
computer guy we know & love) placed third.
</p>
<p>
From here Iʼll just write up events in chronological order. We heard the speech, I was taking notes in my usual random / sporadic / not organized fashion. As I
went through, I tried marking things she did well with a (+) sign, and things to improve with an up arrow. It was difficult looking through my mess. I guess I
tried to write notes chronologically so the plus signs and arrows were intermixed with other stuff. I guess I always like to touch upon the structure as a main
point for the evaluation and say whether I thought it was good or bad. I always felt like structure is an important part of any speech. It shows whether you
had a good outline / train of thought.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, we were shepherd out of the room to another room. This new room was really nice, where the hospital executives probably sit, drink coffee and
discuss stocks. Everyone was focused on their evaluation notes and trying to formulate a speech out of it (myself included). This was probably the most
stressful part of the evening. After 5 minutes they took our notes away. After that, I turned to --22-- who was sitting right next to me (sheʼs with iCIMs,
very funny lady). I said, “OK, now we can talk about the speaker behind her back!” --22--, very responsibly said, “Thatʼs probably not in anyoneʼs best
interest.” Hahaha. We joked for a while back & forth and that led to us joking with everyone else in the room and we got people to laugh at our random
comments. We were also discussing what the test speakerʼs name was. No one seemed to know! I figured if everyone in the room can agree on the *same*
pronunciation, thatʼs a win for us. If the name is wrong, at least everyone pronounces the wrong pronunciation incorrectly! And maybe the target speaker
will think her name has been mispronounced her entire life. Hahahaha.
</p>
<p>
I left the room to use the restroom. When I came back, the room was silent. Some people were standing up, practicing their evaluations semi-out loud.
Some were just sitting down, eyes closed, probably formulating their evaluations in their heads. The Seat Stealer was mouthing her evaluation while pacing
around the room. Basically, from my perspective of someone just walking in the room, it looked like a room of crazies LOL.

I sat there in the seat, closed my eyes to remember my zany notes and carefully pieced together my evaluation. I had a good intro, and tied in that
gentlemanʼs quote that got laughs “That which cannot be cured must be endured.” I really wanted to use that, I figured it would give me an edge. Itʼs a
callback and I already know it would get laughs because it got laughs before. I decided to say that quote upfront preceded with “A wise man once said ...”
because that got laughs when I tried it out during Table Topics at our open house. From there, I picked just three things she did well. I decided to discuss
her speech cadence, speech structure and her tangible points. I said she speaks slowly, deliberately and each word has intention. She had very well placed
paused. I then outlined her speech, *very* concisely. I just wanted to note that she had good organization and move on. Also, her second story was about
her first career with (guess who?) AT&T! When I got to that point, I said, “Something which I am intimately familiar with!” And that got laughs. I then said that
her content is relatable and she has a strong takeaway. I realized I could tie in a wife joke. I said something like, “her speech was about dread and it
connects to the audience really well because who hasnʼt experienced dread? I experience dread every time my wife asks me a question.” I used a variation
of this joke at the Open House and it got laughs there so itʼs reliable. After that I moved on to three points of improvement. When she got up to speak, her
first word was Glossophobia, a big word that means “fear of public speaking.” I said she shouldʼve brought in a prop where she writes that word down (and
attach it to an empty HP box LOL — just kidding, I didnʼt use that line but, now that I think about it, it wouldʼve been a really good joke). But that way, we
know what the word is and how itʼs spelled. I told her, as an evaluator, I panicked because it was the first word that came out of her mouth and I didnʼt know
what it was! That got laughs. :-) I then commented on her body language. I said that sheʼs really good at using her body to speak to us so it wouldʼve
benefited us to see more of that. I wrote that instances of phrases where she couldʼve used body language to help. At this point, the yellow flag had been up
for some time so I panicked! I experienced PTSD from our club meeting that afternoon where I went over time. So I decided to wrap up. I skipped my really
good point of improvement about her incorporating personal stories with each of her examples. My conclusion was good, I tied in something she said about
your desire being greater than your fear. So I said sheʼs exemplifying her own quote by making herself vulnerable in front of us and speaking about her fear.
That was it! So I had planned that out in my head. I then waited for my turn ... the longest wait of my life. It was like waiting at the edge of an airplane before
jumping out — haha. People left one by one and never came back. It was kind of eerie. When my turn was up, I wasnʼt nervous. I had planned out my speech
and knew what to execute. I attached a picture of my evaluation notes to this email, in case youʼre interested.

When I sat back down, I witnessed the Area 63 evaluations but wasnʼt really present in the moment anymore. I was just tired and numb — again. That seems
to be a common theme with Toastmasters contests these days.
</p>
<p>
SO — the biggest laugh of the night award (an award which no one formally recognizes except for me) goes to Paul Ireifej!!! Yay!!! They wanted to rush the
interviews, so --28-- (the interviewer) announced that everyone will just say THREE things: name, club and favorite quote. My quote was, and I quote, “I am
tired and hungry”. I followed that up by saying, “This was said by Paul Ireifej — 2 1/2 hours ago.” This got BIG laughs — both volume and duration. The line
for the candidates doing the interview, as you can imagine, was very long . They had all lined up in front of the room. I had a long walk back to the end of the
line after my turn. By the time I reached the end of the line, people were still laughing. As they laughed, and as I walked to the end of the line, I did a fist
bump with everyone on line. LOL.
</p>
<p>
When they got to announcing the winners, I got lucky!!! They had placed the certificates on a table right in front of me. I saw my name “Paul Ireifej” written
out on a *blue* certificate. I thought, “Wait a minute, isnʼt blue for first place winner?” And I strained my eyes to read the “First Place” on the certificate!!! So
I celebrated at that point — hahaha. I was relived that I didnʼt have to suffer the usual tension & pressure of trying to read the contest chairʼs lips to see what
name they formulate.
</p>
<p>
I was very happy to leave. Thanks for reading my very long email. Iʼd imagine it took you 4.5 hours to read which was the duration of the contest. I literally
spent all day on this email. Iʼve been putting off every AT&T-related task to do this. And I donʼt regret it.
